MCL	10	Blue	2	TXN2	9606.ENSP00000216185	Thioredoxin, mitochondrial; Important for the control of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species homeostasis, apoptosis regulation and cell viability. Possesses a dithiol-reducing activity; Belongs to the thioredoxin family.
MCL	10	Blue	2	UQCR10	9606.ENSP00000332887	Cytochrome b-c1 complex subunit 9; Component of the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, a multisubunit transmembrane complex that is part of the mitochondrial electron transport chain which drives oxidative phosphorylation. The respiratory chain contains 3 multisubunit complexes succinate dehydrogenase (complex II, CII), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (cytochrome b-c1 complex, complex III, CIII) and cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV, CIV), that cooperate to transfer electrons derived from NADH and succinate to molecular oxygen, creating an electrochemical gradient over the inn [...] 
MCL	11	Purple	2	POLG	9606.ENSP00000399851	DNA polymerase subunit gamma-1; Involved in the replication of mitochondrial DNA. Associates with mitochondrial DNA; Belongs to the DNA polymerase type-A family.
MCL	11	Purple	2	TWNK	9606.ENSP00000309595	Twinkle protein, mitochondrial; Involved in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) metabolism. Could function as an adenine nucleotide-dependent DNA helicase. Function inferred to be critical for lifetime maintenance of mtDNA integrity. In vitro, forms in combination with POLG, a processive replication machinery, which can use double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) as template to synthesize single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) molecules. May be a key regulator of mtDNA copy number in mammals.
MCL	12	Pink	2	BCS1L	9606.ENSP00000413908	Mitochondrial chaperone BCS1; Chaperone necessary for the assembly of mitochondrial respiratory chain complex III. Plays an important role in the maintenance of mitochondrial tubular networks, respiratory chain assembly and formation of the LETM1 complex.
MCL	12	Pink	2	FOXRED1	9606.ENSP00000263578	FAD-dependent oxidoreductase domain-containing protein 1; Required for the assembly of the mitochondrial membrane respiratory chain NADH dehydrogenase (Complex I). Involved in mid-late stages of complex I assembly.
